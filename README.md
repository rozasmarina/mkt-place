# Ollivia Web Application

This was a project we developed as our final project on Le Wagon's Full-Stack Web Dev Bootcamp.

## Idea

Everyday, many women suffer harassment all over the world. We developed this application so we could help change this reality.

## How it works
Firstly, it's an app where women can tell their stories and how they we're treated at public places. We want to create awareness and keep others from suffering the same at those places.

Ollivia also has a 'panic button' feature, that enables the user to send S.O.S. messages to contacts previously added to their accountes as angels. The message will contain the address where the user is at and also her coordinates.
